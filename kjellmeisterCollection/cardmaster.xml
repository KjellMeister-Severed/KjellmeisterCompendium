		Running forward with his cloak billowing behind him, a human
		draws three cards from his deck: one green, one red and one orange.
		Finally within range, he throws the cards forward. Each card strikes a
		different target, embedding into their flesh like razor blades. An orc
		becomes wreathed in flame, another is covered in acid, and the last
		one collapses and lets out screams of agonizing pain.
		Pulling out an intricately crafted card embedded with gold, a dwarf
		lifts his hand into the air. He speaks a single word, and the card
		glows a blindly bright gold. All around him, meteors fall from the
		sky, exploding into great balls of flame and light.
		Card Masters are the followers of an ancient magical art, defined
		by the cards that they place in their deck. Utilizing the power stored
		within their collection, Card Masters can create fiery explosions,
		arcane illusions, arcing lightning, and all sorts of spectacular effects.
		Card Masters piece together collections of cards, which serve as their
		way of casting spells.
