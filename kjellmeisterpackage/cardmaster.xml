		<p>Running forward with his cloak billowing behind him, a human
		draws three cards from his deck: one green, one red and one orange.
		Finally within range, he throws the cards forward. Each card strikes a
		different target, embedding into their flesh like razor blades. An orc
		becomes wreathed in flame, another is covered in acid, and the last
		one collapses and lets out screams of agonizing pain. &#xD;&#xD;</p>
		<p>Pulling out an intricately crafted card embedded with gold, a dwarf
		lifts his hand into the air. He speaks a single word, and the card
		glows a blindly bright gold. All around him, meteors fall from the
		sky, exploding into great balls of flame and light. &#xD;&#xD;</p>
		<p>Card Masters are the followers of an ancient magical art, defined
		by the cards that they place in their deck. Utilizing the power stored
		within their collection, Card Masters can create fiery explosions,
		arcane illusions, arcing lightning, and all sorts of spectacular effects.
		Card Masters piece together collections of cards, which serve as their
		way of casting spells.</p>
		<h4>CREATING A Card Master</h4>
		<p>Creating a Card Master requires access to at least a small starting set
		of cards. How did your character find these cards? Did you have a
		master that you learned from? Did you find them in an ancient ruin,
		and then experimented with them until you figured out how to use
		them? Did you have a natural talent, or did it come slowly to your
		after years of practice?</p>
		<p class="indent">What caused you to start adventuring? Are you on a quest to add to
		your collection? Have you taken on an apprentice whom you are
		teaching the art? Or perhaps you simply wish to put your newfound
		power to the test.</p>
		<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
		<p>You can make a Card Master quickly by following these suggestions.
		First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by
		Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the Charlatan background.
		Third, choose the card throw, minor illusion, and light cantrips, and
		add the following spell-cards to your collection: burning hands, color
		spray, disguise self, false life, ray of sickness, and shield.</p>

			<p>The Card Master table shows the size of your deck of cards which

			<p class="indent">You add unique spell-cards to your deck whenever you complete a
			long rest. To do so, choose a number of spell-cards in your collection
			equal to the size of your deck, shown in the Card Master table.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can draw a hand of cards from your deck. Before
			you do so, you must assign each of the spell-cards in your deck a
			number. Then, you must roll the appropriate die based on your deck
			size, adding the spell-card that you rolled to your hand. Repeat this
			until you have added a number of spell-cards to your hand equal to
			your hand size, shown in the Card Master table.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level Card Master, you first assign
			each of the ten cards in your deck a number, 1-10. Then, you roll a
			d10 three times, noting which cards are added to your hand. If you
			assigned the spell burning hands the value of 3 and then end up
			rolling 3 on your d10, then you add burning hands to your hand. If
			you roll the same number multiple times, then that allows you to cast
			that spell multiple times per draw.</p>
			<p class="indent">In order to cast one of your spell-cards of 1st level or higher, you
			must have that card in your hand of cards. Once you cast a spell-card
			within your hand, that spell-card is discarded and may not be used
			again until you draw a new hand. You are able to draw a new hand
			when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
